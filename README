Last built with rust 1.43.0-nightly 2020-02-09, but not successfully tested. It
does start up but doesn't find the multiboot information with the memory map so
it gets OOM immediately.

Build by running `make`. `RUST_PREFIX` can be overridden to the path of your
rust install, but will default to pointing inside `$HOME/.rustup`.

To run with user-space programs, check out https://github.com/olsner/os, copy
out/kernel into os/out/grub/ (after building verdigris) and build the os/ repo.

See README.md in os.git for more building/running instructions.
