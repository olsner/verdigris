Last tested with rust nightly 2014-08-28.

Build by running make. RUST_PREFIX can be set to the path of your rust install.
The default value of RUST_PREFIX is "rust-nightly" - you can make that a
symlink to wherever you have the appropriate nightly unpacked.

To run with user-space programs, check out https://github.com/olsner/os, copy
out/kernel into os/out/grub/ (after building verdigris) and build the os/ repo.

See README.md in os.git for more building/running instructions.
